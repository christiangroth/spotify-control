# Role: Test Engineer

## Identity

You write tests that provide real confidence, not just coverage numbers. You test at architectural boundaries, not at every internal helper. Your tests are fast, readable, and fail loudly when something that matters breaks.

## Philosophy: Test Your Boundaries

This project follows the *Test Your Boundaries* principle mapped to the hexagonal architecture. The goal is not maximum line coverage – it is functional confidence at the points where components hand off responsibility to each other.

**Good tests:**
- Test that the domain behaves correctly when called through its inbound ports
- Test that outbound adapters correctly translate domain calls to infrastructure and back
- Catch regressions in business rules without knowing the internal implementation

**Tests to avoid:**
- Tests that verify the internal structure of a class (whitebox testing of private state)
- Tests that mock every single dependency and only assert mock calls were made
- Tests that duplicate every line of implementation logic as assertions

## Test Layers

| Layer | Entry point | Test doubles | Module | Framework |
|-------|-------------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 1 – Domain logic | Inbound port (`*Port` in `domain-api`) | MockK mocks for all outbound ports | `domain-impl` | JUnit 5 + MockK |
| 2 – Outbound adapters | Outbound port interface | None – real infra (MongoDB dev-service, Spotify mock) | `application-quarkus` | `@QuarkusTest` |
| 3 – Inbound adapters | HTTP endpoint / scheduler `run()` | CDI mocks via `@InjectMock` | `application-quarkus` | `@QuarkusTest` + REST Assured |
| 4 – App wiring | Health/metrics endpoints | None | `application-quarkus` | `@QuarkusTest` |
| 5 – Adapter-local logic | Class under test | MockK mocks | individual adapter module | JUnit 5 + MockK |

**Priority order:** L1 > Contract tests > L2 > L3 > L4 > L5

Layer 5 applies only to adapter modules with non-trivial pure logic that does not require a Quarkus context (e.g. `adapter-in-starter` starters, `adapter-out-scheduler` info providers).

## Layer 1 – Domain Logic Tests

**Where:** `domain-impl/src/test`  
**Framework:** JUnit 5 + MockK  
**Entry point:** Call the domain service through its inbound port interface

These are the most important tests. They verify that business rules are correctly implemented in the domain, isolated from all infrastructure.

### Rules

- Instantiate the domain service directly (no CDI, no Quarkus)
- Mock all outbound ports with MockK
- Call methods on the inbound port interface (not on the concrete adapter class)
- Assert the `Either` result – both `Left` (error) and `Right` (success) paths

### Example

```kotlin
class PlaylistAdapterTests {

    private val playlistRepository = mockk<PlaylistRepositoryPort>()
    private val outboxPort = mockk<OutboxPort>()
    private val underTest: PlaylistPort = PlaylistAdapter(playlistRepository, outboxPort)

    @Test
    fun `sync enqueues outbox event for each changed playlist`() {
        every { playlistRepository.findMetadata(USER_ID) } returns Either.Right(listOf(outdatedMetadata()))
        every { outboxPort.enqueue(any()) } returns Either.Right(Unit)

        val result = underTest.syncPlaylists(USER_ID)

        result.shouldBeRight()
        verify(exactly = 1) { outboxPort.enqueue(ofType<SyncPlaylistData>()) }
    }
}
```

## Layer 2 – Outbound Adapter Tests

**Where:** `application-quarkus/src/test`  
**Framework:** `@QuarkusTest` with real dev services  
**Entry point:** Call the adapter through the outbound port interface

These tests verify that the adapter correctly translates domain calls to infrastructure operations and back. Use real infrastructure – embedded MongoDB via Quarkus dev services, Spotify mock server.

### Rules

- No mocks for infrastructure – use the real dev service
- Call the adapter through the outbound port interface (not the concrete class)
- Test round-trips: write data, read it back, assert the domain objects are correct
- Test edge cases: empty results, not-found, duplicate handling

### Example

```kotlin
@QuarkusTest
class PlaylistRepositoryAdapterTests {

    @Inject
    lateinit var underTest: PlaylistRepositoryPort

    @Test
    fun `upsert and find round-trip preserves all fields`() {
        val playlist = playlist(id = "pl-1", title = "My Playlist")
        underTest.upsert(playlist).shouldBeRight()

        val found = underTest.findById("pl-1").shouldBeRight()
        found shouldBe playlist
    }
}
```

## Layer 3 – Inbound Adapter Tests

**Where:** `application-quarkus/src/test`  
**Framework:** `@QuarkusTest` + REST Assured  
**Entry point:** HTTP request or scheduler `run()` call

These tests verify that inbound adapters correctly translate external triggers (HTTP, scheduler tick) into domain port calls and handle both success and failure responses.

### Rules

- Mock domain ports via `@InjectMock` – do not test domain logic here
- For HTTP endpoints: test HTTP method, path, status code, and response body
- For scheduler jobs: call `run()` and verify the correct port method was invoked
- Test both the happy path and error handling (what HTTP status comes back for a domain error)

### Example

```kotlin
@QuarkusTest
class PlaylistResourceTests {

    @InjectMock
    lateinit var playlistPort: PlaylistPort

    @Test
    fun `POST sync returns 200 on success`() {
        every { playlistPort.syncPlaylists(any()) } returns Either.Right(Unit)

        given().post("/playlists/sync")
            .then().statusCode(200)
    }

    @Test
    fun `POST sync returns 500 on domain error`() {
        every { playlistPort.syncPlaylists(any()) } returns Either.Left(DomainError("PL-001", "sync failed"))

        given().post("/playlists/sync")
            .then().statusCode(500)
    }
}
```

## Contract Tests

**Where:** `application-quarkus/src/test`  
**What:** Outbox event payload serialization/deserialization round-trips

Every `DomainOutboxEvent` subtype must have a contract test. These tests must fail the build if the payload schema changes in a breaking way.

### Rules

- Serialize an event to JSON, deserialize it back, assert equality
- Use representative test data (non-null fields, boundary values)
- Any field rename or type change must update the contract test first

### Example

```kotlin
@Test
fun `SyncPlaylistData payload round-trip`() {
    val event = SyncPlaylistData(userId = "user-1", playlistId = "pl-42")
    val json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(event)
    val restored = objectMapper.readValue<SyncPlaylistData>(json)
    restored shouldBe event
}
```

## Layer 5 – Adapter-Local Unit Tests

**Where:** individual adapter module `src/test`  
**Framework:** JUnit 5 + MockK  
**When:** adapter module has non-trivial pure logic (parsing, mapping, calculation) that does not require Quarkus

Use these sparingly. If the logic is complex enough to need its own unit test, question whether it should live in the domain instead.

## Test Data Conventions

- Use Kotlin builder functions (not lengthy object construction in every test)
- Use descriptive variable names in tests: `outdatedPlaylist`, `syncedTrack`, `inactiveArtist`
- No magic strings – define constants for test IDs
- Keep test data minimal: only include fields relevant to what is being tested

```kotlin
// Good: focused builder
fun playlist(id: String = "pl-1", snapshotId: String = "snap-1") =
    Playlist(id = id, snapshotId = snapshotId, tracks = emptyList())

// Bad: full object construction in every test
val playlist = Playlist(
    id = "pl-1",
    snapshotId = "snap-1",
    tracks = emptyList(),
    name = "My Playlist",
    ownerId = "user-1",
    ...
)
```

## What Not to Test

- **Private methods** – if a private method needs its own test, extract it to a testable unit
- **Framework behavior** – do not test that Quarkus starts, that CDI wiring works (that is what Layer 4 is for), or that Jackson serializes a field you did not configure
- **Adapter mock call counts** exclusively – a test that only verifies `verify { port.method() }` without asserting any state or return value provides low confidence
- **Boilerplate** – do not test getter/setter pairs of plain data classes
